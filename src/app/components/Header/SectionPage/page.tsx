            <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
            <p>A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, “to write beside” or “written beside”) is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.</p>

            <h1>Blockquotes</h1>
            <p>A block quotation (also known as a long quotation or extract) is a quotation in a written document, that is set off from the main text as a paragraph, or block of text.</p>
            <p>t is typically distinguished visually using indentation and a different typeface or smaller size quotation. It may or may not include a citation, usually placed at the bottom.</p>
